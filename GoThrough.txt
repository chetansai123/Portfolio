First we create a react app using npx create-react-app command.Then remove some unnecessary files to make 
the code clean. Then we have to install react-router-dom module to make Routes. Routes are like pages in website
For Getting BrowserRouter,etc ones we install it using command npm i react-router-dom@latest
Then install react-icons module to use react icons for various things like social media etc through command
npm i react-icons@latest.
Then we create a pages folder to create routes that is they are made using BrowserRouter,Routes and Every route is
 specifed as a page.Where we establish the moving to those pages using Links from BrowserRouter.
 Then we make some css styling to make them appear good.
 * For responsive designing we use @media screen and (max-width:1040px) whixh is used to make changes in css when the screen dimensions
 are allowed up to 1040 px i.e basically it is used to style when webpage is seen in phones,tabs etc to make it responsive.
 we make click variable to be clicking the icon among FaBars and FaTimes making the state change by using setClick function.
 we make navbar to be hidden initially and when Fabars is clicked the menu items will appear and by clicking the FaTimes they disappear
 again. These two icons are imported from 'react-icons/fa' where fa is font awesome
 We make different styling in normal css and media queries because we dont want menu icon in laptop devices it is only meant for mobile
 to make it responsive. These styling are made in nav.css because it is used for styling the navbar.
 Then we use FaBars and FaTimes which are react icons which are used for using icons for navbar in responsive designing.
